Haptic And Non-Visual Android Games
==============================

A series of experiments for haptic and otherwise non-visual games for Android; created with generous assistance from the Creativity Innovation Fund and [Harvestworks](http://www.harvestworks.org) (NYC).

Note: for the time being, this repository is a (messy) digital sketchbook - code may not be well annotated or work properly. As the project is finished, substantial clean-up and documentation will happen!
