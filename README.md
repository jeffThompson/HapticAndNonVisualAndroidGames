Haptic And Non-Visual Android Games
==============================

A series of experiments for haptic and otherwise non-visual games for Android; created with generous assistance from the Cultural Innovation Fund and [Harvestworks](http://www.harvestworks.org) (NYC).

Note: for the time being, this repository is a (messy) digital sketchbook - code may not be well annotated or work properly. As the project is finished, substantial clean-up and documentation will happen!

An also-messy Bill of Materials for the project can be found [on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApWbqo450AfRdGZGZERDV3J2ZkhOYmNZS2k5c2tVR1E&usp=sharing). This includes hardware components for extending sensing, interface, and feedback such as vibration motors and (hopefully) smell.
